# Introduction

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

Think of it as running JavaScript in your terminal rather than in the browser.

## Your First Node.js app

Go back to the **root** of your project, and create a `backend` folder. This is where we will put all of our backend code.

In here, create a file called `index.mjs`. This is the entry point of our application.

:::note
In this project, we'll use the `.mjs` extension for our JavaScript files. This is because we'll be using ES Modules, which is a new way of importing and exporting code. You can read more about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).

In this file, add the following code:

```js
console.log('Hello World!');
```

Now, in your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
node index.mjs
```

## Using npm

Our application will use `npm` to manage our dependencies. `npm` is a package manager for JavaScript. It allows you to install and use third-party libraries in your application.

Initialize `npm` in your `backend` folder by running the following command:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This will create a `package.json` file in your `backend` folder. This file will contain information about your application, as well as the dependencies that your application uses.

## Using modules

Node.js has a lot of built-in modules that you can use. For example, the `fs` module allows you to interact with the file system.

You can also import modules from third-party libraries. For example, the `express` module allows you to create a web server.
