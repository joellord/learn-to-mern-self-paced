# Express

Express is a Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

## Installation

From `backend` folder, use npm to install express:

```bash
npm install express
```

You will also need to install CORS.

```bash
npm install cors
```

:::note
Your browser won't let you make requests to a server that is not on the same domain. CORS is a node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.
:::

## Create a GET route

Create a file called `index.mjs` in the `backend` folder. This file will contain the code for your server.

```js
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";

const app = express();
const port = 5050;

app.use(cors());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

## Run the server

From the `backend` folder, run the following command:

```bash
node index.mjs
```

You should see the following message in the console:

```bash
Example app listening at http://localhost:3000
```

:::tip
You can also use `nodemon` to run the server. This will automatically restart the server when you make changes to the code.

```bash
npx nodemon index.mjs
```
