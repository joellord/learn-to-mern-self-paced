# Get working

Time to get that last piece in place. You have a fully functional API, let's connect the front-end to it.

Replace the hard-coded data in your component with a call to the API. You can use the `fetch` API to do this. You can use the following code to retrieve data from the API:

```js
fetch('http://localhost:5050/books')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

Now use the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to store the data in the component's state and render it to the screen.
