# Solution

Well that was a long of content in a day! I hope you were able to get that last part running. If not, here's the solution.

The only file that would've needed some changes is `/src/pages/Books/index.mjs`. Here's the working code:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand!</summary>
<div>

```js
import React, {useState, useEffect} from "react";
import Book from "./Book";

const Books = () => {
  const [books, setBooks] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchBooks = async () => {
      const response = await fetch("http://localhost:5050/books").then(resp => resp.json());
      setBooks(response);
    };
    fetchBooks();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Books</h2>
      {books.map((book, index) => {
        return (
          <Book key={index} {...book} />
        )
      })}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Books;
```
</div>
</details>
