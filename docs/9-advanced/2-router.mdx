# Routing

So far, we have a single page application that literally has a single page. Let's see how we can add multiple pages to our application.

Here, we'll want to create a new page that lists the details of one item from our database. We'll also want to be able to navigate to this page from our home page.

## Installing React Router

React Router is a library that allows us to create multiple pages in our React application. It also allows us to navigate between these pages.

To install React Router, run the following command:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

## Add a Router

To use React Router, we need to wrap our application in a `Router` component. This component is imported from `react-router-dom`. In the App.js file, we'll import this component and wrap our application in it.

We will then change the content of the `Layout` children based on the URL. We'll use the `Routes` component to do this. This component takes a `path` prop and an `element` prop. The `path` prop is the URL that we want to match. The `element` prop is the content that we want to display when the URL matches the `path` prop.

Note that we can use parametrized routes, just as we can in Express. We can use the `:` character to indicate a parameter. We can then access this parameter using the `useParams` hook.

```jsx title="src/App.js"
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Layout from './components/Layout';
import Books from "./pages/Books";
import Book from "./pages/Book";
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Layout>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/book/:bookId" element={<Book />} />
          <Route path="/" element={<Books />} />
        </Routes>
      </Layout>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

</div>
</details>

:::note
Here, we are importing a new component called `Book`. We'll create this component in the next section.

## Creating a new page

Let's create a new page that will show the details of a single item. Using my bookshelf example, I'll call this page `pages/Book/index.jsx`.

This page uses `useState` and `useEffect` to fetch the data for a single book from the database. It uses `useParams` to get the `bookId` from the URL. It then uses this `bookId` to fetch the data for a single book from the database.

<div>

```jsx title="src/pages/Book/index.jsx"
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function Book (props) {
  const [book, setBook] = useState({});
  const { bookId } = useParams();

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchBook = async () => {
      const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:5050/books/${bookId}`);
      const data = await response.json();
      setBook(data);
    }
    fetchBook();
  }, [bookId]);

  return (
    <>
      <h2>{book.title}</h2>

      <p>Author: {book.author}</p>
      <p>Description: {book.description}</p>
      <p>Pages: {book.pages}</p>
      <p>Read: {book.read ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
      {!book.read &&
      <p>Current Page: {book.currentPage}</p>
      }
    </>
  )
}

export default Book;
```

</div>
</details>

:::note
This component is very similar to our `Books/Book.jsx` component. This is intentional. We'll change the latter in the next section.

## Navigating to the new page

Now that we have a new page, you could try it out by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/book/<BOOK_ID>`. However, you'll notice that there is no way to navigate to this page from the home page.

Let's add a link to the home page that will take us to the new page. We can use the `Link` component from `react-router-dom` to do this. This component takes a `to` prop that is the URL that we want to navigate to.

Let's change the `Books/Book.jsx` component to use this `Link` component, and only list the title and a link.

<details>

<div>

```jsx title="src/pages/Books/Book.jsx"
import React from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

const Book = (props) => {
  const { title, _id } = props;
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <Link to={`/book/${_id}`}>View Book</Link>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Book;
```
</div>
</details>
