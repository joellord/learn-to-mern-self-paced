# Even more

Well, I'm not going to do all the work for you. But if you want to do more, here are some ideas:

- Add a delete button to your home page to delete individual items.
- Add an update button to open up a form to update an item.
  - Try reusing the form you already have.
- Add a button in the individual item view to mark it as complete/read/whatever.
- Add a button in the individual item view to delete the item.
