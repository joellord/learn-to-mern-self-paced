# Getting started

Here, we'll see how to create a MongoDB cluster, and how to add the sample data.

## Sign up for a MongoDB account

First, you'll need to sign up for a MongoDB account. You can do that [here](https://mdb.link/try).

## Create a cluster

Once you've signed up, you'll need to create a cluster. You can do that by clicking the "Build a Database" button on the home page.

You'll be taken to a page where you can configure your cluster. You can leave all the defaults as they are, and click the "Create" button at the bottom of the page.

It will take a few minutes for your cluster to be created. You can watch the progress on the "Database" page.

## Add sample data

Once your cluster is created, you can add the sample data. You can do that by clicking the "Load Sample Dataset" option in the dropdown menu under the "..." button.

This will load about 350 Mb of data into your cluster. It will take a few minutes to complete.

Once the data is loaded, you can explore it using the "Browse Collections" button.
