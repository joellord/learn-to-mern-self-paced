# Getting Started

Make sure you have everything you need to get started with this project.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- [Github](https://github.com) account

## Folder Structure

Create a new folder for your project. In here, you will create both your front end and back end. From now on, this folder will be referred to as the **root** folder.

## Decide what you'll build

Sure, you could copy and paste all of my examples, but where's the fun in that? I recommend you come up with your own idea for a project. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, just something that you can build in a few hours.
