# Adding data to MongoDB

Before we connect to our MongoDB database, we need to add some data that we can query. We will do so using the Atlas UI.

Navigate to your Database page, and click on "Browse Collections". From there, click on the "+" button at the top of the left panel to create a new collection.

Give the new database and collection meaningful names. For example, I'll use `bookshelf` and `books` respectively.

Once you've created the collection, click on the "Insert Document" button to add some data. You can copy and paste the array you were using in your application previously.

:::note
You will notice that MongoDB adds a `_id` field to your documents. This is the only mandatory field in MongoDB, and this field will automatically be indexed. From now on, we'll use `_id` instead of `id` or blindly using the array position.
