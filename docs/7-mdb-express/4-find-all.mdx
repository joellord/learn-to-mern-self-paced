# Retrieve all documents

Let's now change the get route to retrieve all documents in the collection.

First, you'll need to add the following dependencies.

```js
import db from "./utils/db";
```

Then, you can change the get route to the following.

```js
app.get("/books", async (req, res) => {
  const books = await db.collection("books").find({}).toArray();
  res.json(books).status(200);
});
```

:::tip
The callback function was changed to an async function here to use the `await` keyword. This is simpler, and more readble than using the `then` keyword.
