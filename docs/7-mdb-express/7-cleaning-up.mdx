# ðŸ¦¸ Advanced - Clean up your code

When you build your API, you will probably have a lot of code. It's important to keep your code clean and organized.

One way to do so, is to list all of our routes in a separate file.

To do so, create a new file called `routes.js` and copy all of your routes in it. Remove the first part of the route. For example, if you had a route called `/books/:id`, change it to `/:id`.

Then, in your `server.js` file, import your routes file and use it as a middleware.

```js
import routes from './routes.js';

app.use('/api', routes);
```

Change `/api` to whatever you want your base URL to be. In the previous example, that would be `/books`.
