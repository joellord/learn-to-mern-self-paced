# Connecting to the database

We'll be using the [MongoClient](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/api-generated/mongoclient.html) class to connect to our database.

To do so, we'll create a new file called `utils/db.mjs`. This file will contain all the logic related to our database.

```js title="src/utils/db.mjs"
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";

const connectionString = process.env.CONN_STRING || "";
const dbName = process.env.DB_NAME || "";

const client = new MongoClient(connectionString);

let conn;
try {
  conn = await client.connect();
} catch(e) {
  console.error(e);
}

let db = conn.db(dbName);

export default db;
```

In there, you can see that we're using the `process.env` object to get the connection string and the database name. For the purpose of this workshop, you could hard-code these values in this `db.mjs` file.
