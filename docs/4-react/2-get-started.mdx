# Get Started with React

The easiest way to get started with React is using Create React App.

In your terminal, from the **root** of your project, run the following command:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

This will take care of setting up a React project for you, including installing React, JSX, ES6, and Flow support.

Once your application is ready, `cd` into that folder, and start the application.

```
cd my-app
npm start
```

This will start a development server, and open your application in a browser.
