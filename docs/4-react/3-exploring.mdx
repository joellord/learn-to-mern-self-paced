# Exploring the App

So, what do we have in here? Let's take a look at the files and folders that were generated for us.

## `src` Folder

The `src` folder is where all of our code will live. It contains a few files to get us started:

- `index.js`: This is the entry point to our app. It's where we'll set up our React app and render it to the DOM.
- `App.js`: This is the main component of our app. It's where we'll put all of our other components.
- `App.css`: This is where we'll put our CSS styles for our app.
- `App.test.js`: This is where we'll write tests for our app.
- `serviceWorker.js`: This is a file that helps us make our app work offline. We won't be using it in this workshop, but it's good to know it's there.

## `public` Folder

The `public` folder contains files that are publicly available to our app. It contains a few files to get us started:

- `index.html`: This is the HTML file that our app will be rendered into. It contains a `<div>` with an `id` of `root` that our app will be rendered into.
