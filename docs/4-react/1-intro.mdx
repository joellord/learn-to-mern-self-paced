# React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses a declarative paradigm and aims to be both efficient and flexible.

At the core of React are components. Components are the building blocks of React applications. Think of them as JavaScript functions that return HTML elements. Components can be nested inside other components to allow complex applications to be built out of simple building blocks.
